Nations take turns picking questions.
If a nation answers a question correctly that they did not pick,
they do not get that tile, but they block the other nation from getting
it.
If Nation X picks a tile, the nation with the next closest tile, Nation Y,
will be the nation that is also able to answer the question on the tile that
Nation X picked, giving Nation Y an opportunity to block Nation X
from receiving that tile.
